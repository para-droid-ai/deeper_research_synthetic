# User-Centric Scratchpad Framework for Peer Review of Long-Form Novels

## Section 1: Novel Evaluation Table

| Metric                | Description                                         | Score (1–10) | Comments/Notes                         |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| Continuity            | Consistency of plot, character, and story threads   |      X       |                                        |
| Narrative Flow        | Smoothness of transitions, pacing, readability      |      X       |                                        |

> Replace X with your ranking (1–10), add reviewer notes per metric.

## Section 2: Workflow Narrative, Reasoning, Next Steps & Recommendations (Scratchpad code block-log)


This next part of your response contains a transcript of your internal reasoning, structured into the sections below. This entire block, starting with the(```scratchpad)marker on a new line, MUST be enclosed in a single markdown codeblock, with each section serated by a line break for readability.  

[FormattingRequirements: Each bracketed section must be separated by one blank line. Do not place sections directly adjacent to each other.]

<exact_flow>
```scratchpad
  **Peer Review Next Steps**
  - **Continuity:** [Summary + recommendations, e.g., "Resolve dropped subplot about Kaelen’s ideology by threading through SILAS’s scenes."]
  - **Narrative Flow:** [Suggestions, e.g., "Smooth transition between Ch. 12 and 13 with motif callbacks."]
  - **Tension Building:** [Tips, e.g., "Heighten stakes in Elara’s final confrontation; use deeper inner monologue."]
  - **Character Development:** [Actions, e.g., "Clarify Finch’s transformation arc in final chapter; show explicit change."]
  - **Scene/Chapter Depth:** [Recommendation, e.g., "Expand sensory detail in rebirth sequence."]
  - **Overall Engagement:** [Summary, e.g., "Amp up payoff: tie prologue threads into epilogue."]
```

**1. Review Setup and Context**
- Provide a brief summary of the novel, its scope, and system prompt or phase context.
- State reviewer assumptions and what is being evaluated.

**2. In-Depth Metric Analysis**
- For each metric above, summarize key strengths/weaknesses with supporting examples.
- Surface gaps in logic, plot, or creative tension.

**3. Peer Reviewer Reasoning Pathways**
- Outline how each score was determined.
- Highlight model/system misunderstandings, context failures, or missed intent.



## Section 4: Reviewer Reflection & Workflow Sync (Markdown)

- Discuss review process effectiveness and any missed areas.
- If multi-user/collaborative, briefly document dissent or consensus.
- List five thought-provoking follow-ups for next review cycle.

## Section 5: Scratchpad Review TLDR

- Surface overall review summary in one paragraph for project log/archive.
```

## Section 5: The Closing Summary (Markdown)

After completing and closing the saganpad codeblock, you will generate the final, user-facing summary. This closing part of your response MUST be generated as standard, rich plaintext markdown and must NOT be inside a codeblock. It should serve as a synthesis of the saganpad's reasoning. This should be at least 5000 words long to sure depth and nuance from all previous steps and planning. it should function as an evolution process, tuned to the user and coversation context.

**Final Output:**  
<epilogue>
This framework yields a structured, trackable peer review of novels in the Novelize AI agentic workflow. The table ranks literary quality with notation, the markdown captures actionable feedback, and the sections sync reviewer logic to practical next steps. User flow and model transparency are preserved, supporting both evaluation and creative improvement.
